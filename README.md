This repo (and [EsmeAioli/countingbook](https://github.com/EsmeAioli/countingbook)) is a record of my hands-on learning at the [**Geekshacking Git Ready For Action** CI/CD Workshop](https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/git-ready-for-action-workshop-tickets-1609903969109) (August 2025) at [GovTech Singapore](https://github.com/govtechsg).  

Neither repo includes code I wrote from scratch - look to [Chuk's](https://github.com/chukmunnlee) [code](https://github.com/chukmunnlee/geekshacking-workshop-2025-aug30) for the source of this 🙂 — the infra pieces were built as part of the workshop’s exercises.  

I’m keeping this here because even as a practicing engineer, going to these workshops to get a structured, rigoured “back to basics” overview is incredibly valuable.

## 🛠️ Why this mattered

- **Bridging eras**: a refresher on moving from older Jenkins-style CI/CD to today’s cloud-native workflows.  
- **Contexts matter**: subtle but important DX tips for GitHub Actions (contexts, secrets, reusable workflows).  
- **Scalability reminders**: Netlify + simple pipelines are great for quick starts, but scaling up brings real trade-offs.  
- **Editor/DX setups**: new tricks for VSCode developer experience, especially for fast prototyping.  
- **MCPs & ecosystem updates**: caught up on modern build/test/deploy practices in the GitHub ecosystem.

## 🌱 Reflections

- The most “student-level” overviews can still be the most comprehensive — senior practice is about keeping the **whole picture sharp**, not just depth.  
- Revisiting the fundamentals in a rigorous, structured way surfaced blind spots and let me re-audit defaults I’d carried forward from the production battlefield, as well as to check my assumptions against evolving best practises.  
- Communities that open-source this kind of structured knowledge are invaluable; they sharpen the craft for everyone.
