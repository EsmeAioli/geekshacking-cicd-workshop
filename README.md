This repo (and [EsmeAioli/countingbook](https://github.com/EsmeAioli/countingbook)) captures my notes and exercises from the hands-on [**Geekshacking Git Ready For Action** CI/CD Workshop](https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/git-ready-for-action-workshop-tickets-1609903969109) (August 2025) at [GovTech Singapore](https://github.com/govtechsg).  

The infra pieces here were built during the workshop — they’re not “portfolio projects” but a record of how I revisited the fundamentals in a structured setting.

## 🛠️ Why this mattered

- **A rigorous end-to-end overview**: the session cut across the entire SDLC, showing clearly how CI/CD solves systemic problems and where it fits into modern delivery pipelines.  
- **Realigning fundamentals with cloud-native practice**: I had previously been responsible for modernising Jenkins pipelines and improving reproducibility so my team could migrate toward cloud-native workflows. Revisiting the fundamentals here let me validate those instincts against current best practices, and translate my production-hardened instincts into today's ecosystem.  
- **Breadth with depth**: in four hours we covered best practices, VSCode add-ons for DX, dependency management, deployment trade-offs, and GitHub Actions design patterns — with room to challenge and clarify live..  
- **Perspective on emphasis**: seeing how an experienced practitioner framed “0→1” learning highlighted what the community regards as the *non-negotiables* versus the optional details.

## 🌱 Reflections

- Senior practice isn’t just deep specialisation — it’s keeping the **whole picture sharp** and checking assumptions against evolving best practices.  
- Revisiting fundamentals in a rigorous way helped surface blind spots and re-audit defaults I’d built up through production battles.  
- Communities that open-source this kind of structured knowledge are invaluable; they sharpen the craft for everyone.
